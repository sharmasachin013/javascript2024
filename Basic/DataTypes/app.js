// salary=50000; pi=3.14

// String Data Type
// => A String is just a combination of words including nos.
// => It is enclosed in  a pair of “    “  or   ‘     ‘ .

// ==============================
// undefined And null
// null and undefined are both data types in JavaScript.
// What Is undefined ?
// It means a variable has been declared, but no value has been assigned to it.
// In simple words we can say that , JavaScript automatically assigns undefined to any variable which is declared but not initialized
// What Is null ?
// It is a value that is assigned by programmer, to indicate that the variable currently has no value but will be initialized later
// In simple words we can say that , null represents intentional absence of the value
// Example
//var age=null  ;         //  age is declared and initialized with null
//console.log(age);  //  Will show null
